# Fabric Mod Package Manager

Cool name for a very dirty project

# How it works?

Install this app via `npm i -g @buj351/mfpkg` and you'll be
able to use `mfpkg` command to install mods for your fabric
server or client. That script only works for everything thats
not windows though, so you have to use git bash instead of whatewer
terrible shell you have on your windows PC that does not support
bash scripts. Also you must be in your server's/client's directory
for it to work properly.

# Before you ask me...

I hope i answered everything...

## Hey, my mods are broken!

sad face.

Just reinstall them one by one via `mfpkg download <minecraft version> <mod name>`

## How can I update my mods?

Since I'm too lazy to implement things like that, use `mfpkg download`

## Please add Forge support <3

no. too lazy for that

## How can I uninstall/toggle mods?

Just delete them from your mods directory
